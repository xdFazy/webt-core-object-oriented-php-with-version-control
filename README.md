# WEBT | CORE | Object Oriented PHP with Version Control

## Overview
The movie fan club “Acolytes of Ash” is looking to create a trailer portal for its members. The members of this club are all fans of “horror” movies which don’t take themselves too seriously.
They want you to create a webapp, which allows them to list trailers of movies, taken from various sources like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.
